# Clash of Cli-Mates

The brief we were given for this hackathon was;

    If you were working for a large company, like BAE Systems, how could you use a web app to promote sustainability,
    to individuals and software development project teams and / or to IT operational teams? You might want to think about
    how you make teams aware of their carbon footprint or to suggest ways that company employees can reduce their own or 
    the companyâ€™s carbon footprint.  You may even want to consider the carbon footprint of your proposed web app. 
    Alternatively you might want to promote other areas of sustainability such as recycling or reducing use of plastic.

## Description

This is a web based app designed to encourage enviromentally sustainable thoughts and actions.
With this app, upon joining the company you would choose a team "Team recycling" or "Team Energy savings" with more teams able to be added. Once in a team you would individually come up with ideas for carbon footprint reduction.
On the app you can choose your team from a drop down menu, then write your idea using an input field and add the amount of carbon saved once your idea is implemented. The amount of carbon saved would be added to your teams bar on the bar chart. The winning team at the end of the year would be rewarded with a budget to implement the idea that most people voted on.

## Running Locally

This site has been made with create-react-app, so to run it locally you can clone the repo and run the script

npm start

### Challenges

Any task you are given to complete in less than one day is going to come with challanges, such as;

    Settling into the team in a quick manor while still promoting a psycologically safe enviroment
    
    Deciding on which idea to run with and which tech stack best suits that project
    
    Splitting the work up so everyone has something enjoyable to do, and the work is spread evenly

### Future Plans

- Finish the functionallity of the App
- Create the back end functionality
- Getting user feedback, so we can adjust the app based on users needs and desires
- Testing frontend and backend, also end to end testing with cypruss
- Moving onto the MLP stage of our app which will be iterated on using the user feedback

### Built with

- Create-React-App
- MUI
- JS
- HTML
- CSS
